	abstract = {Animal tracking data are indispensable for understanding the ecology, behaviour and physiology of mobile or cryptic species. Meaningful signals in these data can be obscured by noise due to imperfect measurement technologies, requiring rigorous quality control as part of any comprehensive analysis. State–space models are powerful tools that separate signal from noise. These tools are ideal for quality control of error-prone location data and for inferring where animals are and what they are doing when they record or transmit other information. However, these statistical models can be challenging and time-consuming to fit to diverse animal tracking data sets. The R package aniMotum eases the tasks of conducting quality control on and inference of changes in movement from animal tracking data. This is achieved via: (1) a simple but extensible workflow that accommodates both novice and experienced users; (2) automated processes that alleviate complexity from data processing and model specification/fitting steps; (3) simple movement models coupled with a powerful numerical optimization approach for rapid and reliable model fitting. We highlight aniMotum's capabilities through three applications to real animal tracking data. Full R code for these and additional applications is included as Supporting Information, so users can gain a deeper understanding of how to use aniMotum for their own analyses.},

	abstract = {During foraging dives, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) produce long series of regular clicks at 0.5–2sintervals interspersed with rapid-click buzzes called ‘creaks’. Sound, depth and orientation recording Dtagswere attached to 23 whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico to test whether the behaviour of divingsperm whales supports the hypothesis that creaks are produced during prey capture. Sperm whales spentmost of their bottom time within one or two depth bands, apparently feeding in vertically stratified preylayers. Creak rates were highest during the bottom phase: 99.8\% of creaks were produced in the deepest50\% of dives, 57\% in the deepest 15\% of dives. Whales swam actively during the bottom phase, producing amean of 12.5 depth inflections per dive. A mean of 32\% of creaks produced during the bottom phaseoccurred within 10 s of an inflection (13 more than chance). Sperm whales actively altered their bodyorientation throughout the bottom phase with significantly increased rates of change during creaks, reflect-ing increased manoeuvring. Sperm whales increased their bottom foraging time when creak rates werehigher. These results all strongly support the hypothesis that creaks are an echolocation signal adapted forforaging, analogous to terminal buzzes in taxonomically diverse echolocating species.},

	abstract = {1. The energetic costs of different behaviours are critical in modulating the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Despite this, measurement of energy expenditure in the field has proved difficult. 2. A new method with broad application for field studies has been proposed for determining the rate at which animals expend energy, based on measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) through the attachment of miniature acceleration data-loggers. This technique is easy to implement and has the promise to be able to resolve energy expenditure with fine (sub-second) temporal resolution, making it the only method which promises to able to determine the cost of short-lived behaviours. Increasing evidence supports the validity of the approach although the rationale behind it is vague. 3. This study explores link between metabolic energy and acceleration by examining what is known about how muscular tissue converts metabolic energy to mechanical work via muscular contraction and how Newtonian physics facilitates a derivation of Power (the rate at which work is performed) from acceleration. The link between metabolic energy and acceleration appears to involve three discrete processes: (i) the ratio of mechanical work to metabolic work performed by a single muscle (mechano-chemical efficiency); (ii) the ratio of external and internal work performed (mechanical work of the limbs in relation to that of the centre of mass); and (iii) the ratio of inertial to de novo mechanical work. These processes may vary according to the animal’s mass, the medium in which it travels and its gait or behaviour. 4. Assessment of movement has limited application in defining non-movement energy expenditure such as that involved in specific dynamic action or non-shivering thermogenesis. However, this non-movement energy expenditure may often be modelled with reasonable confidence. The utility and appropriateness of the ODBA-energy expenditure method depends on a set of conditions, which we define and suggest should be assessed a priori. 5. This study explores the framework behind the ODBA-energy expenditure method to enable informed decisions to be made regarding the suitability for specific research questions addressed, as well as highlighting calibration needs.},

	abstract = {Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0±0.32ms–1) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at {\textasciitilde}1–1.5ms–1 after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge.},

              Ziphius

Each recording included a 30-min playback (one 1.6-s simulated MFA sonar signal repeated every 25 s); one whale was also incidentally exposed to MFA sonar from distant naval exercises. Whales responded strongly to playbacks at low received levels (RLs; 89–127 dB re 1 µPa): after ceasing normal fluking and echolocation, they swam rapidly, silently away, extending both dive duration and subsequent non-foraging interval. Distant sonar exercises (78–106 dB re 1 µPa) did not elicit such responses, suggesting that context may moderate reactions. The observed responses to playback occurred at RLs well below current regulatory thresholds; equivalent responses to operational sonars could elevate stranding risk and reduce foraging efficiency.},

In this study, we (1) review the types of sensors used, the animal taxa studied, and the study areas in marine bio-logging publications from 1974 to 2019; (2) introduce the main topics in behavioural and environmental marine bio-logging studies; and (3) discuss suggestions for future marine bio-logging studies. We expect that technological advances in new sensors will enhance the ability of both behavioural ecologists and oceanographers to explore animal movements, physiology and marine environments. In addition, we discuss future perspectives of bio-loggers to improve data acquisition and accuracy with longer battery life for applying bio-logging techniques to broader species.},

The explosion of miniature sensors that are driving the boom in consumer electronics, such as smart phones, gaming platforms, and wearable fitness devices, are now becoming available to ecologists for remotely monitoring the activities of wild animals. While half a century ago researchers were attaching balloons to the backs of seals to measure their movement, today ecologists have access to an arsenal of sensors that can continuously measure most aspects of an animal's state (e.g., location, behavior, caloric expenditure, interactions with other animals) and external environment (e.g., temperature, salinity, depth). This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories. Here we explore how ecologists are using these tools to answer new questions about the physiological performance, energetics, foraging, migration, habitat selection, and sociality of wild animals, as well as collect data on the environments in which they live.

The study reviewed 22 articles that investigated learning that happened primarily online, was self-directed in nature, and had a primarily adult audience. The author brought together the findings of these individual studies to identified two effective principles of informal online learning design that research dissemination organizations can utilize when developing online outreach education programs for adult audiences: (a) interaction opportunities support knowledge construction and learner empowerment; and (b) segmented, titled, and tagged learning objects facilitate personalized learning. The principles identified in this study not only describe what is known about how adults learn informally online, but also provide the common language and goals to frame the interdisciplinary collaboration likely necessary to employ them.},
